# Project Title
Investigate a Fuel Economy Dataset

# Description
> The data used to determine fuel economy estimates is derived from vehicle testing done at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers who submit their own test data to EPA.Each year, EPA provides fuel economy data to the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that they can administer their fuel economy-related programs.

> - Are more models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much?
> - How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy?
> - What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles?
> - What features are associated with better fuel economy?
> - For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
